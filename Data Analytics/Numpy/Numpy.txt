ðŸ§® NumPy in Python â€” (Numerical Python)
NumPy is a powerful Python library used for numerical computing, especially with large multi-dimensional arrays and matrices. It provides high-performance mathematical functions and tools for working with these arrays.

ðŸ”¹ Why Use NumPy?
Much faster than standard Python lists (implemented in C).

Provides powerful vectorization (operations on entire arrays).

Essential for scientific computing, machine learning, and data analysis.

np.mean(arr)
np.std(arr)
np.sum(arr)
np.max(arr)
np.min(arr)
np.argmax(arr)
np.argsort(arr)


ðŸ”¹ Applications of NumPy
Foundation for libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, OpenCV

Image Processing and Manipulation

Scientific simulations and mathematical modeling

Efficient handling of large datasets
